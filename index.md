This Library Carpentry lesson introduces librarians to working with visualization
in [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/),
[RAWGraphs](http://rawgraphs.io/) and [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/). At the conclusion
of the lesson you will understand:

* how to work with pivot tables to explore and summarize data.
* how to publish graphs in Google Spreadsheets.
* how to use RAWGraphs to create more advanced visualizations
  and plot.ly to create interactive graphs.

On the one hand, we learn to work with certain tools, on the other hand,
we gather “tool-agnostic” visualization skills.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> For this lesson you will need
>
> * a Google account to use with Google Sheets
> * two datasets that can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwbdK-Qs627JWC1ESFMzQzJjaW8?usp=sharing).
>
> The first dataset pertaining new physical library items (*new_physical_items.xslx*) has been extracted from Alma Analytics. After extraction, the publication dates, the publication places and publisher names have been cleaned using OpenRefine's 'text facet' and 'fingerprinting' features. 
> The second dataset (*popular_searches*) includes common user queries, aggregated per month, and has been extracted from Primo Analytics.
