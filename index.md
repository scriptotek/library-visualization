This Library Carpentry lesson introduces librarians to working with visualization
in [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/),
[RAWGraphs](http://rawgraphs.io/) and [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/). At the conclusion
of the lesson you will understand:

* how to work with pivot tables to explore and summarize data.
* how to publish graphs in Google Spreadsheets.
* how to use RAWGraphs to create more advanced visualizations
  and plot.ly to create interactive graphs.

On the one hand, we learn to work with certain tools, on the other hand,
we gather “tool-agnostic” visualization skills.
